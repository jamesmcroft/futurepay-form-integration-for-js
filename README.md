import { FuturePayService, FuturePayType, CurrencyCode, DelayUnit, RegularAgreement, RegularAgreementOption } from 'futurepay-form-integration-for-js';

var service = new FuturePayService();

var agreement = {
        instId: '1234567'
        futurePayType: FuturePayType.Regular,
        intervalUnit: DelayUnit.Month,
        intervalMult: 1,
        startDelayUnit: DelayUnit.Month,
        starDelayMult: 1,
        amount: 60,
        currency: CurrencyCode.GBP,
